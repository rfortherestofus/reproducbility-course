```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      rows.print = 5)
```

## Does this feel familiar?

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.alt = "A confused woman trying to read her code after eight months away", out.height=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("code-8mos.gif")
```


---

## Or maybe this...

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.alt = "A confused man looking at a piece of paper", out.height=500, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("reading-code-i-wrote-last-year.png")

## You are not alone

--

* Researchers could only replicate [21% of 67 drug studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1?linkId=33568131), [40% to 60% of psychology studies](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac4716), and [61% of economics studies](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaf0918)

--

* In a sample of psychology papers, [6% of p-values were incorrectly reported](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2) 

--

* [11% of p-values](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-4-13) were incorrectly reported in a sample of medical papers

--

* [20 to 80% of papers](https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/21/dear-journals-clean-act-regards-concerned-biostatistican/) in each of ten top scientific journals omitted or were unclear about sample sizes and up to 40% of papers in each journal did not include the type of statistical tests performed 

--

* Tables were mislabeled in [three of six reproduced public health studies](https://journals.lww.com/jphmp/Abstract/2019/03000/Examining_the_Reproducibility_of_6_Published.6.aspx)

## What is reproducibility?

--

* Analyses are **reproducible** when analyzing the same data with the same methods produces the same results.

--

* This is different from: 

--

     + **Repeatability**, which is the ability to conduct the same analysis on the same data (regardless of results) 
  
--

     + **Replicability**, which is the ability collect new data, use the same methods, and get the same results (this is the gold standard!)
     
---

## Why does it matter? 


--

* [Errors and omissions](https://jme.bmj.com/content/37/4/249.short) can threaten the foundation of research that practitioners and policy-makers use to make decisions


--

* Poor quality research can also threaten human health with over [400,000 people enrolled and over 70,000 treated](https://jme.bmj.com/content/37/11/688.short) in medical studies later retracted


--

* Retracted research [continues to be cited](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/209653) after retraction, influencing additional science


--

* Adopting reproducible research practices improves quality and reduces errors


---

## How can I make my research reproducible? 

--

* Two things are needed to reproduce research:

--

  + Access to the data 

--

  + Annotated and well-formatted clear statistical code or very detailed instructions
    
---

## Another tool for improving reproducibility 

--

* [Quarto](https://quarto.org) is one of several tools for **literate programming** 

--

* Literate programming tools integrate text with statistical code and output in a single document

--

* By reducing the need to copy results from one software to another, this improves reproducibility
