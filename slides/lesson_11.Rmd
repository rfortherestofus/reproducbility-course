## Reproducing results is a challenge

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.alt = "painting from Mr. Bean movie with face drawn in where painting was ruined", fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mr-bean-reproduced-painting.jpeg')
```

## Code and data files required

--

* To reproduce analyses, the data and code or very detailed instructions for analysis are the necessary components

--

* One way to include everything needed for reproducing analyses is embedding the data, code, and instructions in Quarto html rendered files

    + The `xfun` package is used to embed files

---

## Using the `xfun` package

--

* The `xfun` package can be used to attach a single file, multiple files, or a directory in a knit html document

--

* When multiple files are attached, they are compressed into a zip file, which is embedded

--

* The file, files, or directory is available by clicking on a link in the knit html file
