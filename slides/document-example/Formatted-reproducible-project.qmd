### Project description

Using the **2019 Global Attitudes & Trends** data set from the **Pew Internet & American Life** website, I will answer the research question, *Do perceptions about various U.S. policies under President Trump vary by country?*

The data and code book are available on the Pew website (need free account).

```

### Measurement

To answer my research question, I used a subset of the data that included survey participants responses to the following questions: *As I read some policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, please tell me if you approve or disapprove of each one. How about \[INSERT ITEM\]?*

This paragraph might talk about about the process and statistical methods used. What happened during data management (recoding, missing value handling), which descriptive statistics and statistical tests were used, what assumptions were checked.

### Results

Here is a table showing the basic descriptive statistics.

##### Table. Policy support for Trump policies among 10,000 survey participants in Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, South Korea, United States. (Data source: Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Survey (2019)).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# add labels for table
label(globalData2019clean$country) <- 
  "Country"
label(globalData2019clean$POLICY_CLIMATE) <- 
  "U.S. withdrawal from international climate change agreements"
label(globalData2019clean$POLICY_THEWALL) <- 
  "Building a wall on the border between the U.S. and Mexico"
label(globalData2019clean$POLICY_NUCLEAR) <- 
  "U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear weapons agreement"
label(globalData2019clean$POLICY_IMMIG) <- 
  "Allowing fewer immigrants into the U.S."
label(globalData2019clean$POLICY_TARIFF) <- 
  "U.S. increasing tariffs or fees on imported goods from other countries"
label(globalData2019clean$POLICY_NORTHKOREA) <- 
  "U.S. negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un about the countryâ€™s nuclear weapons program"

# create table
tableDesc <- globalData2019clean %>% 
  summary_factorlist(explanatory = c("POLICY_CLIMATE", 
                                     "POLICY_THEWALL", 
                                     "POLICY_NUCLEAR", 
                                     "POLICY_IMMIG", 
                                     "POLICY_TARIFF", 
                                     "POLICY_NORTHKOREA"))
kable(tableDesc, 
      row.names = FALSE, 
      col.names = c("Characteristic", "Category", "n (%)    "), 
      align = c("l", "l", "r"))
```

Maybe add some text here pointing out anything interesting or unexpected in the table that the readers might want to view more closely. Also explain anything in the table that suggests how the research question might eventually be answered.

### Discussion

After all the methods and results, you would usually summarize the key points from your analyses and add some context by connecting your results to published evidence relevant to your work. Here is where you might add citations. More discussion of the findings that cite some of the literature in this area [@Kolencik2022]. Another statement about the literature and citing it goes here [@Sully2022].
