## Naming things

--

* During the process of writing code, we spend a lot of time naming things

--

* We name the data set we imported, the variables we recoded or created, the functions we developed, and other things

--

* It may feel easier while coding to name your data `dat` or `df` for data frame, a variable might easily become `var1` or, from the [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) data set, `_RFHVDR`

--

* While this is an easy way to go in the moment, when you close that file and then re-open it two weeks later, you may not remember what is in `dat` or what `var1` was measuring 

--

* Instead of going the easy route for naming, taking the time to write names that are consistently formatted and meaningful will make your work more reproducible

## The goal when naming things 

--

* Meaningful to humans and easily read by machines

---

## Two parts to naming things

--

There are two things to consider in naming things:


--

1. The information in the name 
   
--
 
1. The format of the name
    
---

## Part 1: The information in the name

--

* Use meaningful words

--

* Avoid reserved words

--

  + The full list of reserved words is: `if`, `else`, `repeat`, `while`, `function`, `for`, `in`, `next`, `break`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`, `Inf`, `NaN`, `NA`, `NA_integer_`, `NA_real_`, `NA_complex_`, `NA_character_`, `...`

--

* Avoid common functions (e.g., `sum` or `mean`) as much as possible 

---

## Part 2: The format of the name
    
--

* Consistent naming formats for naming data frames will also help you and any collaborators understand your code 

--

* There are many options to choose from when picking a format:

    + `camelCase`
    
    + `dot.case`
    
    + `snake_case`
    
    + `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
    
    + `PascalCase`
    
    + `kebab-case`

---

## How do I choose?

--

* The [tidyverse styleguide](https://style.tidyverse.org) recommends certain formats be used for certain types of objects

--

* **Variable** and **function** names should use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores

    + `snake_case` works well

--

* For other types of objects, pick one of the options and use it consistently

    + For example, file names could always use `kebab-case` while lists could always use `camelCase`

---

## The naming process

--

* For new data frames (imported or typed in), choose a meaningful name with a format you prefer for data frames

--

* For data imported from other sources, try using the `rename()` function that is part of the `tidyverse`

--

* As an example, if the units for the `speed` variable from the `cars` data frame were important, try renaming  

```{r}
# open the tidyverse
library(package = "tidyverse")

# rename the speed variable using snake_case
# name the new data frame using camelCase
carsRecoded <- cars %>% 
  rename(miles_hour = speed)

# check your work
summary(carsRecoded)
```

---

class: my-turn, center, middle

# My Turn

```{r echo = FALSE}
# go to unformatted-r-code.R file and change a couple of the variable names to snake_case all lower case
```

---

class: inverse

## Your Turn

* Open the `unformatted-r-code.R` file and rename the rest of the variables using the suggested formatting 

* Pay attention to the case of the letters (upper or lower) and use `snake_case` to separate any parts of the variable names
