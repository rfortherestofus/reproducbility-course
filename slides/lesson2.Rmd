## Expectations and technical requirements

--

* The course will be taught using [R](https://cran.r-project.org) in the [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) interactive development environment (IDE)

--

* If you do not have administrative access to your computer, you can still follow along by either: 

--

  + Installing R and R Studio to a folder [somewhere you have access to edit and save](https://rpubs.com/tomhopper/windows_nonadmin_install) things rather than to the applications or programs folder
  
--

  + Using an [R Studio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) free account  

--

* The course is designed for those who have some experience with R code, especially [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) 

---

## Course overview

--

* This course will cover coding strategies and literate programming to facilitate reproducible research including: 

--

  + Using space wisely 

--

  + Naming things in a meaningful and consistent way 

--

  + Using function arguments

--

  + Documenting the code with a prolog and annotation
    
--

  + Using seed values for random processes

--

  + Writing functions for repeated tasks

--

  + Integrating code and text

--

  + Embedding data and code files into documents

--

  + Managing project files  
    
---

## Walkthrough of materials 

--

* Several files are included for you to follow along

--

* The data file and codebook file were downloaded directly from the [Pew Internet and American Life](https://www.pewresearch.org/tools-and-resources/) and have not been edited or changed in any way

--

* The data and codebook are from the [Teens and Tech Survey 2018](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/dataset/teens-and-tech-survey-2018/) 

---

## List of files

--

* The files are available in a ZIP file and include: 

--

  + An R code filed called `unformatted-r-code.R`

--

  + A codebook file in a Word document called `Pew Research Center 2019 Global Attitudes Survey WEB` 

--

  + Data in an SPSS file called `Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Spring 2019 Dataset WEB.sav`

--
      
  + RProj file called `reproducibility-course-materials.RProj`

--

  + Text in an unformatted text file `text-for-report.rtf`

---

## The final product

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.alt = "A confused man looking at a piece of paper", out.height=500, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("cake.jpeg")
```

class: inverse

## Your Turn

Run the following code to access the course materials:

```{r}
library(usethis)

use_course("https://rfor.us/reproducibility-materials")
```

--

Once you do this, RStudio should open the project with all of the materials you'll need (your project will be called `reproducibility-course-materials`).
