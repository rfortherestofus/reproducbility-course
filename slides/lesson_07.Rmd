## A random problem for reproducibility

--

* Some statistical approaches rely on random processes 

--

* Each time a random process is implemented, the results will differ due to the randomness

--

* This means random processes will not be reproducible

## How a random processes works

--

* R uses a seed value as a starting point in a random process 

--

* When random processes are called, R uses the current time value as a starting point, this is the default "seed"

--

* Because time changes continuously, R never uses the same default seed 

--

* So, any random process in R, like taking a random sample from a larger data set, will start in a different place and end up with a different result

---

## Example of random sample 

```{r eval = TRUE}
# open the palmer penguins data set
library(package = "palmerpenguins")
# open the tidyverse to get the sample_n function
library(package = "tidyverse")

# sample the value of island variable from 4 observations
sample_n(tbl = penguins, size = 4)
```

---

## Second sample 

```{r eval = TRUE}
# take a second sample with the same parameters
sample_n(tbl = penguins, size = 4)
```

---

## Random sample with `set.seed()`

```{r eval = TRUE}
# set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(seed = 42)

# sample the value of island variable from 4 observations
sample_n(tbl = penguins, size = 4)
```

---

## Second sample after setting seed

```{r eval = TRUE}
# take a second sample with the same parameters
sample_n(tbl = penguins, size = 4)
```

* Oh no! That did not work! What happened?

--

* The problem is that the second random sample was taken without setting the seed again

## Random samples both with set.seed()

```{r eval = TRUE}
# set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(seed = 42)

# sample the value of island variable from 4 observations
sample_n(tbl = penguins, size = 4)
```

---

## Second sample with set.seed()

```{r eval = TRUE}
# set the same seed
set.seed(seed = 42)

# use the same sample code
sample_n(tbl = penguins, size = 4)
```

## Your Turn

* Open the participant `unformatted-r-code.R` file and add `set.seed()` before the sampling code for reproducible results

* Note that the `sample()` function used in these slides will be overwritten by the `sample()` function in `dplyr`
