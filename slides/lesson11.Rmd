## R packages change over time

* R packages are open source, created by the R community members rather than a single company

* R packages are often updated to fix bugs or add or refine features 

* Some updates to R packages can change how a function works or even whether a function exists 

---

## Package changes and reproducibility

* For an R document to be fully reproducible, the version of the package originally used might be needed

* The `renv` package is useful for creating a "lockfile" that stores the versions of R packages used in a document
